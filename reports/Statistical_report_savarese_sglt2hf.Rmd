# Data handling

## Data source

SwedeHF combined with national registers, similar to SHFDB4, 
https://kiheartfailure.github.io/shfdb4/, v 4.0.1, but with longer follow-up. 

## Inclusion/exclusion criteria

```{r, child = "./src/flowchart.Rmd"}

```

*if a patient dies immediately after the index visit he/she will not collect a drug prescribed at the index visit
and thereby be defined as a SGLT2i user. 

First patient in: `r min(rsdata$shf_indexdtm)` and last patient in: `r max(rsdata$shf_indexdtm)`.  

The median age (IQR) is `r rsdata %>% summarise(med = fn(median(shf_age), dig = 1),
                                             q1 = fn(quantile(shf_age, probs = 0.25), dig = 1),
                                             q3 = fn(quantile(shf_age, probs = 0.75), dig = 1)) %>%
                                   mutate(out = paste0(med, " (", q1, "-", q3, ")")) %>%
                                   pull(out)` and 
`r rsdata %>% count(shf_sex) %>%
  mutate(perc = fn(n / sum(n) * 100, 1)) %>%
  filter(shf_sex == "Female") %>%
  pull(perc)`% females.    

## Created variables 

```{r atc}
default_kable(metalm, caption = "Treatments from Prescribed Drug Register")
```

```{r com}
default_kable(outcommeta, caption = "Comorbidities from NPR")
```

```{r cci}
default_kable(ccimeta, caption = "Charlson Comorbidity Index from NPR")
```

Socio-economic variables from LISA are on a yearly basis and set to the year prior 
to registration in SwedeHF. When data was extracted data for 2021 was not available 
and therefore patients with index year 2022 receive values from 2000. 

# Statistical analysis 

## General

All analyses were performed using `r sessionInfo()$R.version$version.string` [@r]. 
The level of significance is set to 5%, two-sided. No adjustment for multiple 
comparisons were made and therefore the results should be viewed with some care.

## Missing data

Missing data was imputed with multiple imputation (n = 10) using mice [@mice]. 
Variables included in the model are indicated in 
Table \ref{tab:tab1}. SGLT2i use is not included in the imputation model.

## SGLT2i over time

In Figure \ref{fig:overtime} the denominator consists of persons that at each half year time period
were present in SwedeHF with the specified inclusion/exclusion criteria 
(so included in SwedeHF prior to 202x-x1/7-01 but not dead/emigrated as of 202x-1/7-01). 
The numerator consists of the number of patients of the above with at least one SGLT2i 
dispension during that halfyear time period. 

In Figure \ref{fig:overtime2} the proportion of patients that, within 5 months 
prior up until 14 days after their registration in SwedeHF, collect an SGLT2 prescription is presented.

The region is "sjukv√•rdsregion" that the hospital/primary care centre belongs to. 

```{r, child = "./src/regional.Rmd"}

```

## Associations with SGLT2i use

Odds ratios are estimated using logistic regression with SGLT2i use as outcome. 
Outliers were investigated with Cook's distance and multicollinearity 
with the variance inflation factor and no action was deemed necessary.

```{r, child = "./src/ortab.Rmd"}

```

\clearpage

## Associations with SGLT2i use in subgroups

Odds ratios are estimated using logistic regression with SGLT2i use as outcome. 
The subgroup variable and the other respective variable were included in the model 
using an interaction thereby rendering the interpretation of a subgroup analyses 
but with the advantage of obtaining a p-value. Note therefore that also the adjusted 
estimates are obtained from different models. 

```{r, child = "./src/ortab_int.Rmd"}
